What I will talk about is what architecture is best for your app.</p><p name="8e5b" id="8e5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hear a lot of talk about architecture patterns in programming, most of the time this all comes from people who have just started programming within the past year wanting to learn about which architecture they will use for their first app. My answer is MVC.</p><figure name="9958" id="9958" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 393px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*XOX4qJ1iJ_bwZn_S." data-width="4096" data-height="2301" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*XOX4qJ1iJ_bwZn_S."></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ravi_roshan_inc?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@ravi_roshan_inc?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Ravi Roshan</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="737a" id="737a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">What!

This also involves discovering what needs to be changed in existing projects.</li><li name="2194" id="2194" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Design — This involves wire-framing, creating image assets, mapping out how your app will function, writing out classes, functions, and variables that will be used and how they are connected. By the time you are done with the design, you should be able to give a flow chart to an outside person and they should be able to tell you high level what the app does.</li><li name="f188" id="f188" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Development — Finally we can start developing, you may not realize it but as an App Developer, it feels like you spend more time doing everything but writing code. Anyways, this is where you *should* start writing out your code. Many people tend to start writing in Design, and others start in Analysis, but as long as you aren’t deleting anything you’re doing good.</li><li name="a61f" id="a61f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Unit Tests — In reality, you should perform unit tests before and after each small piece of code, but it had to go somewhere. Just imagine it as write a failing test, write the method that makes it pass, test again. You’ll be flipping between these roles a lot.</li><li name="fa7e" id="fa7e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Testing — like unit tests, you’ll be going between Development and Testing, if you are lucky, a lot less. Testing is where you run the app just to make sure everything is working as expected, your views are generating correctly, your variables are being set properly, and your data is in the format you expected it to be.</li><li name="dabe" id="dabe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">QA/UAT — Quality Assurance is where you send your project off to people who only have one purpose in life, to crash your app. This is a good thing, it helps to find the edge cases where you failed to catch errors or normalize data. User Acceptance Testing, on the other hand, is where you send this off to people who just use your app and expect it to work. The object of this game is QA fails a little if at all, UAT doesn’t fail.</li><li name="bffb" id="bffb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Release — If you made it here, congrats. This is the point where you start making money from your long nights and countless weekend hours of hard work. Time to start all over again for the next update.</li></ol></div></div></section><section name="fdfb" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="c244" id="c244" class="graf graf--figure graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--leading"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 470px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.10000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*WiwUK8TGJag4gki3." data-width="3670" data-height="2462" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WiwUK8TGJag4gki3."></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">“The top view of creative designer’s office showing books, pencils, laptop, and iphone on a desk” by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aleksdorohovich?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@aleksdorohovich?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Aleks Dorohovich</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="2a5e" id="2a5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the analysis stage start small, think MVC. If you realize you are going to do the UI entirely in code switch it up to MVP. If the project gets to a point where it’s getting hard to read, refactor your workflows to MVVM. You should only need to go to VIPER if you are writing some serious enterprise-grade stuff (think Quickbooks, SolarWinds, Rapid7, Nessus). Ideally, you’d have this figured out before you start development, but as a new programmer, you’ll probably refactor during development.</p><p name="171f" id="171f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It doesn’t mean you can’t use VIPER for a something as simple as a networked Todo app, it just means you’ve now spent more time writing the VIPER boilerplate code than you did your own code for the logic for the App’s primary functionality. If you get to the point where you need MVVM or VIPER you’ll be happy you did because the maintenance is a breeze.</p><p name="19c4" id="19c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Continuing on the idea of a simple networked Todo app, let’s say that it does a lot more than just save your Todo lists, what if it expands on Todo lists and adds in a calendar feature, maybe allows invites, works with Facebook, includes synching with various providers, maybe provides a Gantt chart for those super organized folks. You might consider using MVVM or VIPER up front, even though it really only requires MVC or MVP for what you are writing. Adding in those new features would be comparative to adding a new Cocoapod to your project. Even if you decide I’m going to swap out AFNetworking for Alamofire or vice versa, you only have to change the parts of the functions in the model that handles networking.</p><figure name="73ee" id="73ee" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*rJAXlY1T48ZLHb8i." data-width="5184" data-height="3456" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rJAXlY1T48ZLHb8i."></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@bugsster?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@bugsster?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Taras Shypka</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section name="d97c" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="dd62" id="dd62" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">In summary, I’m only bringing this up because I see a lot of new people who say “I want to learn Swift” two days later they say “I want to learn VIPER.” To these people, I’d say, “Learn Swift using MVC until you are so good with the API that it almost comes naturally, then learn delegation and dependency injection (DI) followed by Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)” Between delegation, DI, and POP you should have your app mostly decoupled. Then you can start focusing on learning MVVM or VIPER.</p><p name="41c7" id="41c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/?time=839" data-href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/?time=839" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Swift is declared as a Protocol-Oriented Programming language</a>. Even Apple says “First, start with a protocol” and I do not disagree. For the beginners out there, stop worrying about which architecture you should use, know the language and most of it’s commonly used classes and structs first.</p><figure name="0cb1" id="0cb1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 280px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 40%;"></div><a href="http://bit.ly/2KkkwGL" data-href="http://bit.ly/2KkkwGL" class="graf-imageAnchor" data-action="image-link" data-action-observe-only="true"rel="noopener"target="_blank"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*5-oC2BqqizoRxIls08WMmA.png" data-width="1250" data-height="500" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5-oC2BqqizoRxIls08WMmA.png"></a></div></figure></div></div></section>
