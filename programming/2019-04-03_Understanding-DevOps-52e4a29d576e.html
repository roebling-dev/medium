Something that I’ve noticed is that most people talk about DevOps like it’s just Kubernetes or just pipelines while others call it a mindset. The first thing I want to say is DevOps is not so much a technology but a role that a department plays within a company.</p><p name="9e62" id="9e62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before I go out and say what DevOps consists of, let’s cover some general ideas of what it is.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1306" id="1306" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Every developer and installation technician has performed DevOps at some point.</li><li name="5f70" id="5f70" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DevOps is required by every company, even if the title is not clearly defined.</li><li name="6dc1" id="6dc1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">DevOps teams work in varying degrees of responsibility, just because a team at Company A does X, does not mean a team at Company B would also do X.</li></ul><p name="99a1" id="99a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Let’s look at a general IT workflow from a developer standpoint.</p><h4 name="ac2c" id="ac2c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Developers:</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="8811" id="8811" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Plan</strong> for changes to their code</li><li name="4077" id="4077" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Code</strong> new changes for the next feature</li><li name="7d63" id="7d63" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Build</strong> the application changes</li><li name="d2b0" id="d2b0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Test</strong> the application’s changes for issues</li><li name="7418" id="7418" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Release</strong> the changes into the production environment.</li></ul><p name="29e6" id="29e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">For some companies this release cycle takes months, others may be less; this is normal.</p><p name="42f7" id="42f7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The operations team has a different workflow:</p><p name="d265" id="d265" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Operations:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="d6c7" id="d6c7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Deploy</strong> new code into the correct environment.</li><li name="43e7" id="43e7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Monitor</strong> the changes for issues</li><li name="915f" id="915f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Respond to issues, or <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Feedback</strong></li></ul><p name="d0ee" id="d0ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">While it seems that developers have more work on their hands because they have more tasks; the operations team almost always has their hands full responding to tickets from users not understanding the new changes or issues that the users face due to bugs.</p><p name="88b0" id="88b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m sure some developers are saying my code is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">always </em>perfect, I hate to break it to you, but it takes many years of improvements to make your code near perfect. I’ve seen a 20-year old code base still have bugs. It doesn’t mean bad developers wrote it.</p><p name="60db" id="60db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I firmly believe the business pushed the deadlines over code completeness causing the developers to make quality sacrifices along the way. As future updates were released the technical debt rose while new bugs got created as features got added. Sure, they went back and fixed those old bugs, but because new features got released, more recent issues became technical debt.</p><p name="406f" id="406f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s a vicious cycle that many developers have to face. Agile software development was supposed to fix this by having teams work together. Instead, businesses just used the project management team to relay the business demands to developers and left this to be what agile is today. Not cool.</p><p name="d93a" id="d93a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The idea behind agile software development was to give developers a leg to stand on when working on new features for a project. Developers could talk with other teams and work out a plan that would benefit the business requirements. It was to discuss with the business what could get done in the given timeline, or adjust the deadline so that all the requested features could get implemented correctly.</p></div></div></section><section name="ad44" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a6a3" id="a6a3" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">The operations team has its own set of requirements. Operations are required to understand the changes that got introduced in the release, plan for potential problems, respond quickly to any that occur, and report back to the developers on their findings.</p><p name="5d90" id="5d90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While this may sound easy to the developers reading this, you have to remember that your next release cycle outside of break-fix issues will not happen for another month and the operations team will suffer until you fix those pesky bugs. How are they supposed to monitor all that you do plus the systems they manage if they are always putting out fires?</p><h3 name="f2b1" id="f2b1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The DevOps Way</h3><p name="ee59" id="ee59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There’s always been a feud between the operations team and developers; both accuse the other of being inept. Until you live in the shoes of both worlds for a while, you’ll keep thinking this way.</p><p name="4bde" id="4bde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started off working in the help desk of a few companies for longer than I wanted. I then moved up to Systems Administrator and cursed at the developers when I understood enough code to realize they were not handling basic errors, like network requests. Every admin knows the only thing you can count on is for something to go down at the most inopportune time.</p><p name="258c" id="258c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you go to any company and ask one of their Admins, who has worked at the company for longer than a year “What are your common issues”, they will almost certainly come back with a spreadsheet of items about the entire environment.</p><p name="931c" id="931c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you ask the same of an equivalent developer, it will be a spreadsheet of items about only the software environment.</p><p name="80f5" id="80f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you ask the same of someone outside of the IT department, they will respond with “Our IT department needs work.” Rarely do I hear anything nice.</p><p name="09c9" id="09c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Agile was supposed to fix this, but instead what it was really supposed to be was lost along the way but somehow still came about in the name of DevOps.</p><p name="f366" id="f366" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">DevOps is the unification of Operations and Development. A typical DevOps workflow looks like this:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="372a" id="372a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Plan</strong> for the next release</li><li name="8439" id="8439" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Code</strong> new features</li><li name="34c2" id="34c2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Build</strong> the code for testing</li><li name="36d8" id="36d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Test</strong> the new and old code</li><li name="07d4" id="07d4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Release</strong> the code to the production staging area</li><li name="b33f" id="b33f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Deploy</strong> the code to production</li><li name="a2c2" id="a2c2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Monitor</strong> for issues</li><li name="fbcd" id="fbcd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Get user <strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Feedback</strong></li><li name="b51e" id="b51e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Repeat with the feedback gained.</li></ul><p name="3cd5" id="3cd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This workflow is essentially taking the roles of Developers and Operations and combining them. It does <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Not</em></strong> mean that Developers and Operations should become one group; it just means that the act of the two groups working together becomes DevOps.</p><p name="2acd" id="2acd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You may have seen/heard of a DevOps team; this is a specialized team that consists of people with experience in both Administration and Development that work to provide a smooth transition between the two groups.</p><p name="6d21" id="6d21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An example using the more popular Atlassian lineup, the DevOps team would be responsible for setting up BitBucket to hold the code repositories, Bamboo to create and maintain pipelines, and the connections to servers where the code will be deployed.</p><p name="d5f5" id="d5f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this scenario, it is still the developers’ responsibility to write tests for the pipelines and to push their code to the repository, and it is still operations’ responsibility to maintain, troubleshoot, and configure the servers where the code is getting deployed.</p><p name="b481" id="b481" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another example, the DevOps team installs and configures Gitlab, utilizes the built-in pipelines, builds the Kubernetes cluster, and sets the integration between Kubernetes and Gitlab.</p><p name="1d23" id="1d23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this scenario, the developers’ responsibility doesn’t change. However, it is upon the operations team to monitor the Kubernetes cluster for issues, review logs, detect failing pods, and perform remediation tasks on problems that occur. The DevOps team might be involved with writing scripts to manage pods or provide solutions to fixes while the operations team is working with the developers on break-fix changes.</p><p name="e509" id="e509" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The DevOps team may also be involved with writing ReSTful APIs that can be utilized by developers to ensure proper connections to the databases which are managed by the data management team. This way the environment becomes language agnostic.</p><p name="6078" id="6078" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By using DevOps, you can strengthen your code base due to feedback from operations. You improve the morale between developers and operations by allowing them to peek into each other’s way of doing business.</p><figure name="a402" id="a402" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*52QdFcYtL-xaFWZS" data-width="6016" data-height="4016" data-unsplash-photo-id="n95VMLxqM2I" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*52QdFcYtL-xaFWZS"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cytonn_photography?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@cytonn_photography?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">Cytonn Photography</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="e6ed" id="e6ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">DevOps naturally leads you to break things into services, i.e., microservices. It does this because feedback occurs so quickly on the operations side, that developers are more willing to quickly fix the bug while it’s fresh in their mind. The developers make the change, push the code, and within 10 minutes a fixed version is available all because of the work done by DevOps. If you have fixes going in every 10 minutes, you are more inclined to break up the code into smaller pieces so you can fix a bug in another service (or module) while the previous fix is getting deployed.</p><p name="e29e" id="e29e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you start to feel comfortable about DevOps and microservices, you end up naturally moving towards serverless, where you just have functions sitting out there dormant until called upon to perform some line of work before going back to sleep. These are typically so small that the DevOps team can write them, they can be relatable to new-age stored procedures that are called every once in a while to return a subset of data.</p><p name="3082" id="3082" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So a question that might come up is “Will DevOps teams automate themselves out of a job?” There is so much work that a DevOps team can do that I would have to say no. A DevOps team responsibility is to take the load off of developers so they can do what they do best: write code. They also provide tools to help free up operations to do what they do best: maintain systems.</p><p name="2c6a" id="2c6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You can ask any developer if they like deploying code all day and they will say no, likewise, if you ask any operations person if they like troubleshooting issues all day, they will also tell you no. Does this mean everyone would hate working in a DevOps team? I’m going to tell you no. From my perspective, it is cool stuff. Not only do you make your developers happier by not having to build pipelines, but you also please operations by freeing up their time to focus on responding to issues and maintaining the environment.</p><p name="58e4" id="58e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Earlier I mentioned every developer and operations person had done DevOps at one point in their career if you have ever tested your code and deployed it to a system that was DevOps. If you have ever mitigated an issue that your customer had or wrote a script to automate a process to keep things running smoothly, that was DevOps.</p><p name="42d8" id="42d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">A good book that I recently read that can provide you more insight on how DevOps plays a role within a company is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Phoenix Project</em> by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford</a>.
