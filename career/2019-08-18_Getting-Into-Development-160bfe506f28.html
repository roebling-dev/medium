Before this, I was a systems admin for eight years.</p><p name="4628" id="4628" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I first started COBOL in 2014. I was amazed at the lack of information online about how to do anything in this language. You have to read the documentation to figure it out.</p><p name="70cd" id="70cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because my job was split between dev and admin, I didn’t have much of an opportunity to write code. I spent most of my evenings and weekends trying to learn how to write COBOL.</p><p name="6f8b" id="6f8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Around late 2014 I still hadn’t had much of an opportunity to learn COBOL, but I was getting interested in iOS development with Objective-C. This was very different from what I was used to but I liked it much better than COBOL for all of the built-in functionality provided by the standard library.</p><p name="5924" id="5924" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was also around this time when work started picking up and they asked me to write an application for Windows.</p><p name="4c63" id="4c63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started my trek by purchasing a course to learn <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" data-href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">C#</a>. I learned a lot on my first run through, but mostly about structuring code and performing small tasks.</p><p name="7685" id="7685" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had my foundation of variables and constants, conditional statements, basic expressions, and an understanding of what the standard library contained and what could be expected in other languages.</p><p name="25cf" id="25cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On my second run through the course, I learned more about the various domain layers of applications and structuring applications for future modifications. By the end of it, I was able to write simple applications to get work done.</p><p name="7d9d" id="7d9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before moving on to another job in 2017, I was able to write a gateway monitoring application that would switch the network over to a backup system as a failover.</p><p name="f6e0" id="f6e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the meantime, I continued learning. In 2015 I started with Swift. I enjoyed the language but it was hard to learn. Not because of the syntax but because I had all of these preconceived ideas about how C# was doing work and I was essentially trying to write Swift as I would C#.</p><p name="0b04" id="0b04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once I recognized this, I started reading up on how to properly structure my code in Swift, how to leverage some of the ideas that were unique to Swift to improve my coding skills.</p><p name="c26b" id="c26b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It wasn’t until I decided to try and write a full iOS application, complete with views, databases, and networking, that I started to understand the language.</p></div></div></section><section name="fbd0" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="4e9e" id="4e9e" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Getting Into Design</h3><p name="2e93" id="2e93" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Along the way, I ended up taking a crash course in design, not just user interfaces (UI) but also taking into consideration user experience (UX).</p><p name="11fc" id="11fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple asks its developers to meet a set of human interface guidelines. These require each developer to adhere to rules that ensure a similar UI/UX exists between all apps.</p><p name="8128" id="8128" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When getting into design, I started learning about colors, shades, harmony, the bezier pen tool, and various vector and photo design programs. It took about a year to start making designs that I didn’t think were trash; however, my architecture skills were still less than desired.</p></div></div></section><section name="c4d8" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="5134" id="5134" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Back to the Foundations</h3><p name="9932" id="9932" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At one point while learning Swift, I got stuck, a piece of code wasn’t working correctly, and I had no idea why.</p><p name="2f45" id="2f45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I knew that most object-oriented languages today come from implementations done in C++. Since C++ is spun off of C, I decided to try and learn C instead. I figured, if I went back to the foundations of modern programming, I would have clarity on what I should be doing.</p><p name="c617" id="c617" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I audited the Harvard’s CS50X on <a href="https://edx.org" data-href="https://edx.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">edx.org</a> to point me in the right direction. I didn’t feel that I needed a completion certificate as I already had “developer” on my resume.</p><p name="91d0" id="91d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first few lessons just introduced me to the language on topics I already knew. However, when I came to the subject of pointers, my mind melted. I thought: “This is freaking hard,” and it was.</p><p name="1853" id="1853" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It took me about five weeks of research to finally understand what pointers were, why they were necessary, and how they were used. Once I realized this one concept, things in C# and Swift made sense. I continued the course until I got to the PHP section (now Python) and switched gears back to Swift.</p></div></div></section><section name="13f2" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="8eae" id="8eae" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Newfound Clarity</h3><p name="01ac" id="01ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I attacked my application with newfound clarity. Looking over my code, I would say: “This is shit” and replace it with something more performant or something more explicit.</p><p name="787c" id="787c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understanding pointers made me understand more about classes, arrays, and dictionaries, even if they are value types in Swift. Again, going back to the roots of object-oriented programming (OOP) made me think of things in a brand new light.</p><p name="5445" id="5445" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s now late 2016, early 2017, and I’m looking at extending my application with things like JSON and XML serialization.</p><p name="cb63" id="cb63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my professional career, I was getting tired of being an admin on the phone all the time. My creative side was chomping at the bit to develop new things.</p><p name="f91b" id="f91b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In mid-2017, I took a job at my current company, where I started as a COBOL developer. The difference now was that I had a better understanding of program structure, program flow, and both OOP and structured language programming.</p><p name="1a62" id="1a62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would consider this to be my first developer job as I spent more time as an admin in my previous position.</p><p name="f5fb" id="f5fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I followed the adage “fake it until you make it” and I made it. It took a lot of nights and weekends and many free courses. I only purchased one for $150 and found the material about the same as the free courses.</p></div></div></section><section name="d22f" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="ea4f" id="ea4f" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">New Passion</h3><p name="88d9" id="88d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">With this job came an agreement that anything I worked out outside of the company became intellectual property (IP) of the company.</p><p name="7f12" id="7f12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Because of this, I halted progress on my iOS application and focused more on work. One thing that didn’t change was learning something new every night. Whether in C, C#, Swift, or COBOL didn’t matter as long as I learned something.</p><p name="61b2" id="61b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I finally felt like I had a passion for what I did. I wasn’t distracted by phones anymore and I didn’t mind working over as a salaried employee because of the work environment. This was when I discovered that a company’s culture matters.</p><p name="486d" id="486d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The typical culture I’ve experienced is everything short of forced labor. Managers would micromanage or be distrusting of employees, which created a hostility in the environment that was hard to pinpoint, but the feeling was palpable.</p><p name="02b2" id="02b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If you work somewhere with this environment and you don’t believe in the product or service; my suggestion is to find another job. You’ll be much happier.</p></div></div></section><section name="d9ad" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="5c60" id="5c60" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Object-Oriented Programming</h3><p name="b037" id="b037" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In mid-2018, I grew tired of structure programming, while I didn’t have a problem writing COBOL, I wanted to do OOP again.</p><p name="c24c" id="c24c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I missed the pre-built functions and classes from the standard libraries. I didn’t want to leave the company, even with the rule about IP in place, so I looked in other departments that were not writing COBOL.</p><p name="4958" id="4958" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I found an opening for a Linux administrator. It was a little more than just an administrator; it was a position in DevOps, more focused on the developer side writing Python. Here was my chance to get back to OOP languages and learn new skills.</p><p name="90b5" id="90b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got the job and was immediately placed on a large project written in Python.</p><p name="144a" id="144a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I picked up Python relatively quickly, roughly two weekends, and I was proficient enough to write a broad application. I think what sped up my learning was how similar the standard library is to Swift.</p><p name="d4a1" id="d4a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While writing this application, I had a crash course in JavaScript.</p><p name="1d3f" id="1d3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never having touched it before, this was difficult. I ended up leveraging <a href="https://jquery.com/" data-href="https://jquery.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and learned a bit about async requests to update the UI as various options were selected.</p><p name="f3d6" id="f3d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was also when writing this application that I wrote a good architecture.</p><p name="0b4d" id="0b4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I learned to leverage frameworks to speed up development and make my life a little easier. The only downside is that every framework is different, so you have to learn how to use each one.</p><p name="cc62" id="cc62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While in my new position, I’ve also picked up Markdown, <a href="https://yaml.org/" data-href="https://yaml.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YAML</a>, <a href="https://www.perl.org/" data-href="https://www.perl.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Perl</a>, and <a href="https://golang.org/" data-href="https://golang.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Go</a> while improving my <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview" data-href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PowerShell</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" data-href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bash</a>, and batch scripting.</p><p name="685d" id="685d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The most important thing you can do as a developer is to keep your tools sharp and relevant. The learning never ends.</p></div></div></section>
