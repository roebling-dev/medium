If I continued down this path, I would have surely ended up in jail before the age of 21.</p><p name="46c1" id="46c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One day I received an unexpected phone call. “Is this Robert Roebling?” asked the unknown caller. “Yes, it is,” I replied. When the unknown caller introduced himself as a recruiter for the U.S. Army National Guard, I wanted to hang up immediately as if it were some telemarketer trying to sell me something. Being polite, I listened with little interest while he gave me his spiel to try to recruit me.</p><p name="8e85" id="8e85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I started to tell him that I wasn’t interested, but he immediately shot back, “Do you want to blow shit up?” Ok, I don’t know about you, but to me, this was every boy’s dream. He had my full attention for the remainder of the call. It was near the end where I set up an appointment to meet him at the local armory.</p><p name="1e80" id="1e80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was excited; my mind raced with the different jobs I could perform while serving my country. After a week had gone by, I had in my mind that I’d either want to work in a hospital or do something cool like military intelligence(MI). I chose these because deep down my moral compass didn’t want me to kill people.</p><h3 name="8232" id="8232" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Test</h3><p name="3b47" id="3b47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After our first appointment, I set up another date to take the ASVAB (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery). This test covered many different areas of intelligence and knowledge. While I won’t give out details of the test, I can say that it was pretty straightforward until they asked me about a subject that I knew next to nothing about.</p><p name="064b" id="064b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I finished, my test was graded, and I spoke with the recruiter again. He was surprised that I scored 86% on the test while he pulled out a book of positions. He went through the book and told me I could pick any job I wanted except for MI. I looked through the book and saw positions for infantry, artillery, communications, and one labeled “Health Care Specialist.”</p><p name="842c" id="842c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I want to do this,” I said, pointing to the entry. He said that sounds good we need more of those. I felt relaxed, I got what I wanted, he got what he wanted, and before our meeting was up, I had set a date a year out when I would go to Basic training after I had graduated from high school. I felt like I had made a deal with the devil and won.</p><h3 name="4408" id="4408" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Training</h3><p name="5def" id="5def" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">During basic, my whole life was turned upside down. Many people will claim that this is “brainwashing.” I can tell you right now, it’s not. It is conditioning people to deal with chaos. Basic for me was only nine weeks long. The first three weeks is just drill sergeants breaking your spirits. No matter what you do, they find a way to tear you down, that nothing you do is right.</p><p name="fef3" id="fef3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a week we tried to one-up them. We stayed up all night, our fireguard shifts of two-man teams would spend time cleaning the barracks bay. Each shift taking on a different responsibility of sweeping, mopping, waxing the floors, cleaning the latrines, etc. Since fireguard shifts took 3 weeks to go through everyone in the bay, each person would only have to do three cleaning tasks during the entire nine weeks.</p><p name="7410" id="7410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Morning came, everyone was already up and dressed in physical training (PT) gear, as this was a part of the last fireguard shift’s duty. The drill sergeants came through with white gloves and attempted to find something wrong. They couldn’t. While no one was smiling, you could tell that inside, every recruit was brimming from ear to ear.</p><p name="a2b9" id="a2b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The two drill sergeants met in the middle of the bay, also known as the kill-zone for any poor recruit caught in it. After a few seconds, one nodded and left, while the second drill sergeant went into the bathrooms. About a minute later, the first drill sergeant came back with a small ball-peen hammer. “Oh, f —… what is going on?” I thought. The first drill sergeant walks up to the concrete wall next to the bathrooms and taps it hard enough to cause the block to crumble a little on the floor.</p><p name="3257" id="3257" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He picked it up and said, “What is this? You jokers can’t even clean a bay, front-leaning rest position, MOVE!” Front-leaning rest position is synonymous with the push-up position. We were going to get smoked; a term coined from punishment by exercise because when you were properly smoked, steam could be seen coming off the punished.</p><p name="349b" id="349b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stuff like this went on for the first three weeks, designed to make you stop trying to think ahead. In the next three weeks, it was rifle training and drill and ceremony (D and C). D and C is where we practiced marching, weapon inspections, and all that jazz you see on TV when a high official walks down the line.</p><p name="7984" id="7984" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The last three weeks consisted of training to build us up, instill confidence in ourselves and those leading us into battle. We did confidence courses which required us to work with our squadmates to accomplish tasks such as scaling walls and making bridges over gaps.</p></div></div></section><section name="f80e" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c157" id="c157" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After Basic, I entered Advanced Individual Training (AIT) where I started to learn how to be a medic; the training was 16 weeks long. Here we learned how to treat trauma wounds, administer IVs, medications, perform medical analysis of the sick, and triage patients during mass casualty incidents.</p><p name="14fb" id="14fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The training was tough, but after all of it, I felt prepared to take care of the sick and wounded, and I was ready to return to my unit back home. It was also at this point I realized, I’d end up as a front-line medic, not holed up in a hospital.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="38c5" id="38c5" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1032px; max-height: 759px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 73.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*__n5hR0giJ8OGEtrCjN1mw.jpeg" data-width="1683" data-height="1238" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*__n5hR0giJ8OGEtrCjN1mw.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Combat Life Saver Training, Ft.

After a few keywords were said, I was told to report to the armory for deployment to Iraq, scheduled 2 months out. I couldn’t believe it. I just got home, this isn’t fair.</p><p name="5d33" id="5d33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I reported in, hoping this was just some drill, but to my dismay, it was the real deal. Two months later, I was on my way for training in Fort Dix, NJ, where my unit would break the base record for number of days in the field at 104 days. Here we learned route security, how to raid buildings, and detainee operations. Fun fact: 5% pepper spray (detainee ops) tastes like Taco Bell Fire sauce and burns the same when it lands in your eyes. We laughed about wanting some to make our MREs taste better later that day.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="043b" id="043b" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1032px; max-height: 774px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*6vXYcr6qE3bqQtLuKw8MoQ.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="960" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6vXYcr6qE3bqQtLuKw8MoQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Heading towards the rifle ranges, Kuwait, Nov. 10, 2005</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="baa0" id="baa0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">The Desert</h4><p name="e103" id="e103" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">About 2 hours after we got on the plane to Kuwait, I fell asleep. When I woke up it was 6 am local time, and we were about to land in Rammstein Air Force Base, Germany. I had never been this far from home before and it was a surreal experience.</p><p name="a03c" id="a03c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Interestingly enough, Germany felt like home, except a tad more flat. We were only there for a short time to refuel and finish our trip to Kuwait. I couldn’t sleep this time though, not because of nerves, but because of my prior slumber.</p><p name="b9db" id="b9db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we landed, I stepped off the plane into 90º F weather. It was a dry heat and felt more like 78º F. It wasn’t too bad, except I had to carry two duffle bags, my aid bag, and my rifle, which, including me at 145 lbs, weighed 275 lbs. I could see for miles, an ocean of tan.</p><p name="497f" id="497f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’d stay in Kuwait for two weeks to climatize ourselves to the desert heat before moving on to Baghdad.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="af18" id="af18" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1032px; max-height: 774px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*j9mqJoajTiPPnKlRfSMF3g.jpeg" data-width="2048" data-height="1536" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*j9mqJoajTiPPnKlRfSMF3g.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Baghdad, Nov. 21, 2005</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="03d2" id="03d2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">The City</h4><p name="e062" id="e062" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As we came into Baghdad, our C-130 performed a combat landing. Troops lovingly call the C-130 “the flying trashcan”, I didn’t know why until I had experienced my first combat landing. I didn’t know such a big plane could be so agile. It took us about 5 minutes to land. The nose was pitched so deep that I started to fear that we might just crash into the ground. We leveled off right before we touched down. When we did, we came down hard. I had never been so happy to leave a plane in my life.</p><p name="233e" id="233e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I got out, I looked around, and even though I had never been to Utah, I figured this is what it probably looked like.

Before I get into what happened on this day, I want to talk about the layout. We were on a routine mission at an Iraqi police station checking on prisoners and inspecting the overall operation of the station. To the northeast is the market you see above, to the southwest is an elementary school, and to the southeast is a beautiful shrine with a golden spire and one of the more prestigious writing forms of Arabic out of the seven different writing styles.</p><p name="614c" id="614c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The police station was designed as a square, there was an outer courtyard that wrapped around the southeast side of the square, while an inner open courtyard containing offices and police barracks occupied the northwest corner.</p><p name="4026" id="4026" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At 8:50 am local time, I was asked to check on the prisoners in the northeast corner of the inner courtyard, making sure they were being fed, given water, and other amenities that we provide in American jails. I had just pulled out the first prisoner and was questioning him on his treatment and he said he was being treated well.</p><p name="28a7" id="28a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We were halfway through his questioning when I heard a deafening boom. A slight wind brushed across my face, and I felt a slight thud that I felt travel from the right side to the left side of my body as I was facing north.</p><p name="d358" id="d358" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I dropped to a knee, extended my rifle’s buttstock and prepared myself for the worst. My first assessment told me this was a mortar attack and I started looking for some shelter that would shield me from shrapnel from subsequent attacks. The best option was to get back inside the room I had left. The prisoner was escorted back to his cell during this time.</p><p name="eb20" id="eb20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I heard my platoon sergeant say something, but I couldn’t make it out. It sounded like “GET DOWN!”, after he said it again, I heard it more clearly. “GET OUT!” The only way out from here was to leave the inner courtyard using the south entrance to the outer courtyard, then leave out of the northeast corner of the outer courtyard back to the trucks waiting outside.</p><p name="68f3" id="68f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I make it to the trucks and as I’m making my way I can hear sticks cracking on the ground amidst the screaming. I get to the truck and I ask the gunner, “What’s going on?” He responds, “a bomb blew up in the market.” Oh shit!</p><p name="df85" id="df85" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I open my door and look back at the truck’s gunner behind me to see if he’s ok, since he was closest to the market, and I see him swiveling back and forth, ready to light up anything that even looks at him the wrong way. Behind him, the smoke is lifting and the dust is settling, people are crying and screaming, some on the ground not moving at all.</p><p name="8abe" id="8abe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I close my door and see people running from down the street holding their faces running to the scene. I wait for a few more minutes and realize that I was the only one who made it out. I tell the gunner I’m going to go check on everyone else and leave the truck.</p><p name="a90b" id="a90b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On my way back I attempted to head towards the market to see if anyone needed help, but my interpreter, Sam, pulled me back saying “if they see you, they will kill you.” As difficult as it was that I couldn’t save a life, I understood and ran back inside.</p><p name="555a" id="555a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I get back to the inner courtyard, the crackling sticks become more persistent. My platoon sergeant comes down from the roof and informs us that 500 al Qaeda are marching down the street with weapons. Iraqi police officers are defending the police station, some coming back in through the door holding appendages, some sitting in the outer courtyard bandaging their wounds.</p><p name="35bb" id="35bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At this point, we realized that the militia members were right outside and flooding the market place, we needed to get back to our trucks. We used a side door after shooting the lock off and cut through the elementary school courtyard back to the trucks.</p><p name="3b24" id="3b24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once we got in, one of the other platoons contacted us and gave us directions that would keep us away from the militia members. After 10 minutes of back roads, we finally get out of that part of the city and start heading back to base. The carnage still freshly burned in my mind, I had no comprehension of what I saw.</p><p name="9892" id="9892" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we got back, we went straight to a large tent and received our debriefing while another platoon unloaded our trucks. We spoke with a base counselor to try and help us comprehend what we went through, which was really talk of “It’s over, time to move on.”</p><p name="634a" id="634a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later that day, I heard the report, 59 people were killed, and 104 others were injured. I had no idea it was that bad. The part that burned me the most, “No US troops were present.” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Forgotten because of PR.</em></p><p name="28e5" id="28e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I did ok for a few weeks then the fear set in. I started having sessions with base counselors which ultimately led nowhere. I didn’t talk to my family about what had happened nor did I want to expose them to the ultraviolence that occurred that day. I just wanted to come back home and make them think nothing happened over there.</p><p name="b2a7" id="b2a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After 6 months in Najaf, we moved to Diwaniyah where I’d spend 3 more months before my orders would be extended for 3 more months.

Little did we know what was ahead of us.</p><p name="03a5" id="03a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I slept most of the trip home but woke up when it was announced we were flying into Canada to refuel and stretch our legs.</p><p name="c980" id="c980" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We didn’t leave the airport as everything we needed was inside, we shopped at the duty-free shop for souvenirs and ate a little food before getting back on the plane. Everyone was clowning at this point and no one could sleep. Some of our guys even got up and performed the safety directions.</p><p name="b11a" id="b11a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we were preparing to land in Indianapolis, I could hear a few people mutter under their breath. I looked out the window and saw there was snow on the ground. At that time, the captain came over the radio and said it was 10º F outside. Once we disembarked, one by one, we all kissed the ground. We were glad to be back.</p><h3 name="966e" id="966e" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Adapting to Change</h3><p name="2e73" id="2e73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At this point, I had been with a rifle for 15 months every day. If I lost it, I’d be in serious trouble. This was the first thing they took back when I got home. I felt lighter. I felt at ease. I felt like I was missing something. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Panic.</em></p><p name="0a22" id="0a22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being around my brothers helped ease this transition, we all accustomed to the new lifestyle together. In the meantime, we had enough suicide prevention courses that some joked about actually committing suicide so they wouldn’t have to sit through another. We were tough, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we were invincible.</em> No one would ever do that.</p><p name="6ee6" id="6ee6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the two weeks, a few of us started talking about coincidence. We discovered that each time we moved, we were around the same special forces group, even had them do ride alongs with us on some missions. As we ran missions, we’d get hit by a roadside bomb, they’d run raids in that area, we’d get hit shortly after, they’d run another and then it would be quiet for a while. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Were we just bait to lure the insurgents out?</em></p><p name="86f1" id="86f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After two weeks, we finally went home, riding on firetrucks the last few miles. We arrived at the armory, standing tall and proud, standing like heroes, but not feeling like heroes. We felt like average Americans who were just being celebrated for doing their regular job.</p><p name="7a06" id="7a06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We felt normal. When they fired the paraffin rounds from the howitzers behind us, we all jumped 5 feet, it was at this point, we knew something was wrong. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">We just couldn’t admit it</em>.</p><p name="867e" id="867e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first few months were great, we all had enough leave leftover to pay us for 6 months before we needed to have another source of income. The first 2 months were easy-going but the rainbows and bunny rabbits quickly disappeared after that.</p><p name="8d84" id="8d84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following months were hell, a pure rollercoaster of emotions where we didn’t know what was going to happen next. My family saw the worst of it. If I asked for something to happen and it wasn’t done immediately, I treated it like it was life or death if it didn’t happen now. I’d almost be ready for a fist-fight if the mail didn’t get dropped off while I was at work. “How could you spend an entire day at home, and NOT do a single thing?” I didn’t realize it then, but now I can look back and realize that the anger came from the things I buried deep inside to hide my own mortality so I could survive. That day, if the mail didn’t get dropped off, someone could have died. My reaction was correct for the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">perceived reason</em> I yelled, but not correct for the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">current situation</em>.</p><p name="2396" id="2396" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Within 6 months, I lost my first brother to PTSD. I didn’t know the full story. I heard that his girlfriend left him for relationship problems, he didn’t know what to do, so he shot himself. Watching parents bury their child is the hardest thing I’ve ever witnessed.</p><figure name="952a" id="952a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Fq2PWaRDfOWhPfyyh6lAow.jpeg" data-width="3072" data-height="2304" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Fq2PWaRDfOWhPfyyh6lAow.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Going again, Feb. 18, 2008</figcaption></figure><h3 name="e134" id="e134" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Round Two</h3><p name="9fa8" id="9fa8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Within a year, I realized I couldn’t deal with civilian life, so I went over again to feed my need for an adrenalin rush and to rejoin my brothers under the belief that they needed me to ensure they could come home.</p><p name="f406" id="f406" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This time we were going to Mosul, where I’d turn 22 and spend the next 12 months of my life drinking green Monsters and Wild Tiger energy drinks like they were my lifeblood. They did the job and kept me awake to check the roads for bombs, so in some respects they probably were. I would come back with over 450 missions under my belt before the age of 24.</p><p name="3e28" id="3e28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This time when I came back, I knew what to expect and felt prepared. This is when I started going to college, 6 years after I graduated high school.</p><h3 name="af88" id="af88" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Loss</h3><p name="94e4" id="94e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Within the first 5 years of being back home, I lost 5 more brothers and sisters in arms to their invisible wounds. Some because their wives left them, others for seemingly no reason at all. From my tour in Mosul, we lost every single member of a truck to PTSD and some of us have an eerie picture with all 3 members of the truck together.</p><p name="9a40" id="9a40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The last funeral I went to I’ll never forget her mom’s words, “I just want my baby back.” as she cried and fell to her knees at the podium. This was the first time my wife had ever experienced a military loss and it affected her deeply. I think it affected us all in some way.</p><p name="75bf" id="75bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since then some of us have been getting together with others on a regular basis as a buddy check. This is also around the time where one of my brothers started <a href="http://soldierdogs.org/" data-href="http://soldierdogs.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Soldier Dogs for Independence</a>. One of the dogs was given to a gunner who lost the other two members of his truck to PTSD and possibly saved his life. I strongly suggest anyone dealing with PTSD to look into getting a service dog.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="1eda" id="1eda" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1032px; max-height: 774px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*MSAWFnOS-vS2oMHaMCkfug.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="960" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*MSAWFnOS-vS2oMHaMCkfug.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Sunrise in Najaf</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="4904" id="4904" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Otherside</h3><p name="5279" id="5279" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I dealt with night terrors, night sweats, jumping at loud noises, anxiety in crowds, jumping at someone touching my shoulder when I wasn’t expecting it, becoming easily agitated, and shakiness when I got home. I was diagnosed with PTSD shortly after.</p><p name="ad86" id="ad86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve gone through counseling many times, but only noticed an improvement after I started going to a bible study once a week called Pointman. This was created by a veteran out of Texas and they provide outreaches in most cities through the United States.</p><p name="3ac7" id="3ac7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I got over many of my symptoms after attending, thanks to God. I still have night sweats, jumpiness, and agitation. I figure talking to a counselor will help me understand the reasons behind my agitation, and maybe work on uncovering some of the emotions deep down that I buried that are required to understanding and overcoming my anxiety and agitation.</p><p name="dd06" id="dd06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I marked a lot of things in this article that I told myself or beliefs that most likely attributed to my issues using <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">italics.</em></p><p name="e9b1" id="e9b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important to recognize that the military tore me down to make me feel invincible so I could perform tasks that would cause others to hesitate too long. They taught me to bury emotions so I could react faster to chaos. There isn’t a process to unlearn this.</p><p name="1798" id="1798" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can say that the military did straighten my life up, it brought a great foundation and plenty of structure. It was the symptoms of war that brought me down.</p><p name="7cf2" id="7cf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I cannot tell you that you have PTSD just because I have it, but I can tell you that if you have gone through something difficult in your life that affects your daily activities, you should definitely check up on it.</p><p name="ebdc" id="ebdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you ever have thoughts of harming yourself or others, please seek help.</p><p name="9bae" id="9bae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1–800–273-TALK (8255)</strong></p><p name="d277" id="d277" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Veterans Crisis Line — <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1–800–273–8255</strong> and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Press 1</strong></p></div></div></section>
